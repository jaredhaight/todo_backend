This is a simple todo site. It will be used as a playground for stuff like:

* Implementing an API in Django (django-rest-framework)
* Using AngularJS to interact with said API
* Playing with Zurb's Foundation CSS framework
* Learning to build apps in a more modular fashion
* Being pulled down to a new server via Chef
